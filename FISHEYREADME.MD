# Mickey Fish Fan Kata

You’ve always admired Michael Fish—his calm voice, his precise forecasts. But lately, you've become convinced that there's more to his weather reports than meets the eye. Every word he says feels like a coded message, meant just for you. You’ve spent hours rewatching his broadcasts, jotting down notes, and searching for hidden meanings in his phrasing. You’re sure he’s trying to communicate something important, but you just can't crack the code.

You tried calling the BBC to ask him directly, but you couldn’t get through. Then you went to his house, desperate for answers. But the police got involved, and now you’re not allowed within 500 metres of him. You’re certain that if you keep watching his forecasts, you’ll uncover the truth.

You just need a little more time to decode the message. Then you’ll finally understand what Michael Fish has been trying to tell you. 

## Write a function that takes the first letter of every word in Michaels broadcast and retruns it string.

## Example 

```
"intermittent gusts near oxford. rain easing. temperatures hovering early. residents expect showers. tomorrow's radar anticipates isolated northward inland nasty gales. outlook relatively dry. expect rain"
```
should return 
```
'ignoretherestrainingorder'
```

## Setup
- Cd to main directory 

- Open a terminal and enter:
```
npm run fish
```
- Open and write your solution within the empty function in 'main.js' 
```
export function fisheyFunction(mickeyPeram) {
    //your fishey function here
}
```
