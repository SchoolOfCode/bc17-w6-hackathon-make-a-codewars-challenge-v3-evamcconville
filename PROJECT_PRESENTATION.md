# Reflections
- pocess: 
Our objective was to create a code kata that others could try to solve. I began by writing out a plan that can be seen below. I read through the readme and tried to extract as many induvidual points as possible.  We looked through the codewars site as a team trying to get an idea about what different katas looked like. We also used chatbots to make some of our kata ideas fit our team's theme of Micheal fish. I used tdd to write tests to eventually solve the kata that id created. I don't think this made any difference to the outcome of how the kata was presented but it showed me that my kata was solveable and it did let me practice writing tests.... I used a chatbot to create a weatherforcast string that had the forst letter of each word spell out a message. 

- teamwork: 
Brainstorming as a team and talking about how to approach the hackathon was really usefull. We often asked eachother how to solve spesific problems we were having with our implementaion wich menat none of us got stuck for very long. We each reminded each other to include things that might have been left of eachothers plans.

- problems: 
I took quite a long time deciding what kind of kata to make but eventually i decided just to focus on a simple challange first and think about how to impliment more complex kata requrements after. 

- improvements: 
If i had more time i could have added some more complexity to the kata relating to the mvps listed below. I don't think the tests for my kata were perticularty interesting and would have liked to impliment some other skills we learned this week but to do this I would have had to change the style of my kata compleatly.

# MVPS 
- Return the fist letter of every word of a string - COMPLETE
- Ensure all is lower case if string has capitalisation
- Return the letters of a string that corraspond to the indexes of an array

# PLAN
- create plan doc
- read through readme

## Ticket 1 - Setup
- npm install
- npm install vitest in main dir
- add vitest script in package.json
- import { test, expect } from 'vitest' into test.js
- write empty test in test file
- npm run test script to check if test passes

- write empty function in main.js
- export empty function in main.js
- import empty function from "./main" into test.js

## Ticket 2 - Plan your kata
### brainstorm ideas
- look through codewars examples
- mvp ideas

### write instruction readme
- setup instructions (cd to folder, npm run fish, write solution funcion)
- describe story scenario
- give clear objective
- give spesifications
- give example
- add kata senario as comment in main.js

## Ticket 3 - Write your kata
- write a failing test in test.js
- write funtion to pass test
- repeat TDD

## Ticket 4 - Check your tests
- remove passing function
- check all tests fail
- ask teammates to write funtion to pass tests

## Ticket 5 - Share your kata
- push to github
- change to public repo
- share to hakathon channel 

## Write presentaion reflections
- pocess
- teamwork
- problems
- solutions
- improvements
